Okay, I've reviewed the provided code snippet:

```javascript
function sum() {return a+b;}
```

Here's my assessment and suggestions:

**Issues Identified:**

1.  **Missing Parameters:** The function `sum` is intended to calculate the sum of two numbers, but it doesn't accept any parameters (input values).  It relies on `a` and `b` being defined in some outer scope.  This is generally bad practice because:
    *   **Scope Dependency:** It makes the function's behavior unpredictable and dependent on the context where it's called.  If `a` and `b` are not defined in the calling scope, you'll get errors or unexpected results.
    *   **Reusability:** It limits the reusability of the function. You can only use it to add those specific `a` and `b` variables.
    *   **Maintainability:** It makes the code harder to understand and maintain.  You have to trace back to figure out where `a` and `b` are defined.

2.  **Implicit Global Variables (Potential):** If `a` and `b` are not declared with `var`, `let`, or `const` *anywhere* in the code, assigning values to them inside or outside the function will implicitly create them as global variables.  This pollutes the global namespace and can lead to conflicts and bugs.

**Recommendations:**

The best solution is to pass the numbers you want to add as parameters to the `sum` function:

```javascript
function sum(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
```

**Explanation of Changes:**

*   **Parameters:** We've added `a` and `b` as parameters to the function definition: `function sum(a, b)`.  Now, when you call the function, you *must* provide the two numbers you want to add.

**Example Usage:**

```javascript
let result = sum(5, 3); // result will be 8
console.log(result);

let x = 10;
let y = 20;
let total = sum(x, y); // total will be 30
console.log(total);
```

**Why this is better:**

*   **Explicit Dependencies:** The function now clearly states that it *requires* two numbers as input.
*   **Self-Contained:** The function is self-contained and doesn't rely on variables defined elsewhere.
*   **Reusability:** You can use the `sum` function with any two numbers you want.
*   **Predictability:** The function's behavior is predictable. It will always return the sum of the two numbers you pass to it.
*   **Maintainability:**  The code is easier to understand and maintain.  The function's purpose and inputs are clear.

**Alternative (Less Recommended, but Sometimes Useful): Using Default Parameters**

If you want to provide default values for `a` and `b` in case they are not provided when the function is called, you can use default parameters:

```javascript
function sum(a = 0, b = 0) {
  return a + b;
}

console.log(sum());      // Output: 0 (both a and b default to 0)
console.log(sum(5));     // Output: 5 (a is 5, b defaults to 0)
console.log(sum(5, 3));  // Output: 8 (a is 5, b is 3)
```

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Variable Declarations:** *Always* declare your variables using `var`, `let`, or `const`. Avoid creating implicit global variables.
*   **Error Handling (Optional):**  You might want to add error handling to your `sum` function to check if the inputs are actually numbers.  For example:

    ```javascript
    function sum(a, b) {
      if (typeof a !== 'number' || typeof b !== 'number') {
        return "Error: Inputs must be numbers"; // Or throw an error
      }
      return a + b;
    }
    ```

In summary, the original code had significant issues related to scope, reusability, and potential global variable pollution.  Passing parameters to the function is the correct and recommended way to implement a `sum` function.  Consider default parameters and error handling for added flexibility and robustness.
